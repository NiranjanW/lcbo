# LCBO: The Ruby Gem

This library is used to gather data for [LCBO API](http://lcboapi.com). It
allows you to request and parse store, product, inventory, product list, and
store list pages directly from the [LCBO](http://lcbo.com) website.

## Synopsis

    require 'lcbo'

    LCBO.store(511)
    # => { :id => 511, :name => "King & Spadina", ... }

    LCBO.product(18)
    # => { :id => 18, :name => "Heineken Lager", ... }

    LCBO.inventory(18)
    # => { :id => 18, :inventory_count => 40398, :inventories => [ ... ] }

    LCBO.products_list(1)
    # => { :page => 1, :final_page => 108, ..., :product_ids => [ ... ] }

    LCBO.store_list
    # => { :store_ids => [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 8, 9, 10, 11, ...] }
